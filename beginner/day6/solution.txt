Todays goal was to get familiar with different loops. For that course used reebogs world found here:

Final project was to make robot go trough the maze. This is my solution:

def turn_right():           <------- first I made function to turn right, because game doesnt have that by default.
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()

while not at_goal():        <------- as long as we are not on the goal tile, code will run.
    if front_is_clear():    
        move()
    elif wall_in_front() and wall_on_right:
        turn_left()
    while not wall_on_right():
        if at_goal():
            break
        else:
            turn_right()
            move()
